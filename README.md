# WoW-Servers

This is a Discord bot that tracks when WoW servers go down for maintenance, and also when they go up (return "online"). It will send an alert to a chosen discord server, the alert will include a nice WoW graphic or animation, with a funny quote and information on why the servers went down, along with estimated wait time.
